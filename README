Light-weight syntax highlighting for PHP that -
	- Is server-side
	- Requires no boiler plate code
	- Works like markup
	- No escaping characters or forcing line breaks

Usage:

1. Include code.php

2. Put code in between code::start() and code::end()

Example: 

&lt;?php code::start();?&gt;

// code...
$blah = "hihi";

&lt;?php code::end();&gt;
